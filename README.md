## 🔐 Permissions

When you run the tool for the first time, Microsoft will prompt you to sign in and approve access to Microsoft Graph permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|----------------|
| User.Read | To identify you and sign in securely |
| GroupMember.Read.All | To read group-based PIM role eligibilities |
| RoleManagement.Read.Directory | To view which PIM roles you're eligible for |
| RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory | To activate/deactivate eligible roles on your behalf |
| Directory.Read.All | To read directory information for role operations |

📌 These permissions are **delegated** meaning they only apply while you're signed in interactively using MFA.

👉 If you're the first person in your tenant to use the tool, Microsoft Entra may ask your admin to approve the requested permissions. This is a one-time step built into the Microsoft sign-in experience – no separate setup or consent URL is needed.
